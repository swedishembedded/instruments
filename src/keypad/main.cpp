 * This example shows the implementation of a standalone process peripheral.
 * This process gets three arguments passed to it by the simulation side:
 *
 * - main socket: this socket is used for requests initiated by the emulator
 * - irq socket: this socket is used for requests initiated by this process
 * - address: the IP address of the emulator
 *
 * By connecting back to the emulator using the supplied sockets, we can then
 * communicate with the emulator side and get messages sent to us whenever
 * firmware reads or writes some memory assigned to this particular device.
 *
 * This example is intentionally kept raw and very simple - using raw unix
 * sockets. This is to show the core concept without any dependencies. Remember
 * that sockets are byte streams - so ideally there should be a packet protocol
 * on top. Here it works anyway because we are running very close to the
 * simulation and connections never break.
